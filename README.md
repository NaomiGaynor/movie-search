# movie-search
Simple web app allowing user to search the movie-DB for their favourite movies and TV-shows

### Overview
I am aware that this task could have been completed with much fewer javascript modules, but I wanted to show properly structured es6 code with decent architecture and data flow.

Future addons could be:
- to initially show top rated films before initial search
- handle the ui gracefully if no search results were not returned
- allow user to click on a search result to see more film content

### Initiailisation
- npm install
- npm run start || npm run build

### Test
- npm run test
